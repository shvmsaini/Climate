# Climate
This app provides current temperature and weather condition (by icon) by using GPS location or city name.

This app uses [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to grab the weather data.

All the codes are based on java.

I am working on Android Studio 4.0 Minimum SDK: API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop).DK: API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop).

**Note: Please insert your own API key(APP_ID) in WeatherController.java file.**
